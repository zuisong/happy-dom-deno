# About

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface. It includes many web standards from WHATWG [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/).

The goal of [Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering.

[Happy DOM](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) focuses heavily on performance and can be used as an alternative to [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).

### DOM Features

- Custom Elements (Web Components)

- Shadow Root (Shadow DOM)

- Declarative Shadow DOM

- Mutation Observer

- Tree Walker

- Fetch

And much more..

# Usage

## Basic Usage

A simple example of how you can use Happy DOM.

```javascript
import { Window } from 'npm:happy-dom-deno';

const window = new Window();
const document = window.document;

document.body.innerHTML = '<div class="container"></div>';

const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const button = document.createElement('button');

container.appendChild(button);

// Outputs "<div class="container"><button></button></div>"
console.log(document.body.innerHTML);
```
